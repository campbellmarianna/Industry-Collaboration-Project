- There were a lot of unknowns of how to connect the buttons
- Edwin asked can I show you something or can I help in anyway
- In pages do we want components
- I realized after seeing the implementation on the course detail view how to give a route to a button in React and that is where things started to click for me

Ask (Not Sure of):
- useState in Nav how does that effect the rest of the app or other components on the page
- I'm not sure I'm using the right state
- How to handle sign in functionality with the Sign in Menu.item element
- Can the sign in logic be put into the navbar component

Thoughts for improvement:
- Have the wireframes be more clear for desired output
  - Example: for a course screen the desired colors so that it is a unified experience throughout the app
